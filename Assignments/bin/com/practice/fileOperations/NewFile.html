Sub:  Visitors visa extension for my parents
<br /><br />
Dear Sir/Madam,
<br /><br />
I am enclosing the application and the documents herewith for the extension of stay for my parents
who are currently in the U.S. on B-2 tourist visa. According to their current I-94, their authorized stay expires on 07/31/2004. However, <!--1359512221973--> they would like to extend their stay in the U.S. until 11/05/2004.
<br />
<br />

As they are elderly, they have not been able to make extensive travel as it would be very exhausting for
them. Moreover, my work schedule and commitments don't allow me to take multiple longer vacations in a short duration.
During their current stay, they have seen several places on the east coast. However, they are yet to see other many famous tourist  <!--1359512221973-->locations in the western United States such as Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Hollywood, 
Disneyland, San Francisco etc. As they are getting older, they may not be able to visit us again. Therefore,
I would like to show them tourist destinations in the western United States during this visit itself.
<br />
<br />
During their extended stay, they will continue to stay at my house located at 
123 Park Avenue, Iselin, NJ 08830 and I will continue to provide all financial support to them during that time.
<br /><br />
Please find the following documents enclosed herewith:<br />
* Copies of Form I-94<br />
* Copies of all pages of passports<br />
* Copies of Return airline tickets<br />
* Proof of financial support including <a href="/forms/i-134.html">Form I-134</a>, bank statements, employment letter,
recent paystubs and account verification letter from the bank<br />
<br />

Please note that my parents have strong ties to India. They have their business, other children, grand children and other family in India. They have absolutely no intention to stay permanently in the USA. I assure you <!--1359512221973--> that they will promptly return to their home in India before the end of their authorized extension of stay.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, I respectfully request you to approve their extension of stay and provide us with an extended I-94.
<br /><br />
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this application, please feel free to contact me at any time at
732-391-9293 (Home) or 732-733-4087 (Work).
<br /><br />
Sincerely, 
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Rahul Gupta
